## Anything else?

For professional purposes, email is my only communication channel. 

Sticking to one well-established, written platform is amazing for productivity and clear communication. I've done many projects this way and it has never been an issue.

You can also reach me through my other main websites (see [about](/en/info/about)). These usually have a separate mailing address and social channels attached. I, however, do not regularly check those and don't consider them viable for professional purposes.

## When should I contact you?

Visit [my workflow](/en/info/workflow) or [about](/en/info/about) to see the things I typically do and how I work. Or explore this portfolio to get a taste of my work!
