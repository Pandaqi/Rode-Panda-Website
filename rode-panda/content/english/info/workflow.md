This page explains a bit about my workflow. It clarifies for which projects I might be suitable or how I can help with your current project. If anything is unclear, never hesitate to contact me!

## What I can do

I have years of experience in multiple artistic fields (writing, programming, design, music). This portfolio, hopefully, shows that. 

This means I can help with any part of your project that overlaps these fields. 

It also means, however, that I like doing _multiple aspects_ of a project. I like to vary my workload. Find the unusual connections between these areas to make something that's more than the sum of its parts.

Instead of focusing on _one thing only_ (such as programming), I focus on _how everything comes together_ (such as the relationship between a the code of a website and its design).

I'm the typical "idea guy" with a vision, who (begrudgingly) trained himself to also be able to _execute_ that vision.

## Communication

I prefer clear and honest communication. I will never lie or pretend to agree with something, nor will I give vague responses or updates. My written communication is precise and efficient.

It also means I expect the same from my clients. If I ask a specific question, please give me the answer. Most time is wasted on asking my clients the same question ten times until they finally answer _half_ of it! That's fine, but know that it's your money and project going down the drain.

### Project Proposals

I will not start a project until we've agreed upon the _specifics_ of it.

* The exact work that needs to be completed.
* Any deadlines or extra requirements.
* The exact payment for it, including when and how it's paid.

Sure, requirements can change. I'm flexible! I try to make it work and I try to talk you through it. As the old saying goes: &ldquo;Ask a programmer to estimate when a feature is complete ... and they will be wrong!&rdquo;

But it's preferable to keep that to a minimum, as last-minute changes always do more harm than good. Depending on the agreement, there might also come a point at which I must simply ignore the never-ending changes to the proposal.

As such, it's best to send me a detailed offer and we can work out the details together.

### My rates

This means I have no fixed (hourly) rates. It all depends on the project.

Nevertheless, below are some general thoughts.

* If it's a one-time task, I'll probably ask a one-time figure. (With a clear indication of the work required and when.)
* If it's a bigger ongoing project, especially without clear end date, I'll ask hourly wages. (Based on what I feel is fair.)
* I'm not working for "exposure" or "promises". Nor should anybody else.

## When I do my best work

I'm not the type to say "well creativity just takes a special passion or mind-set" or to "wait for inspiration to strike". I bang my head against the wall, 8 hours a day, trying everything until I crack a problem and deliver the product way before the deadline.

Hire me, and I'll give my all to work hard and just create cool stuff that hopefully improves the lives of some people. Something that gives enjoyment, helps them waste some time, or maybe even teaches them something new.

I'm at my best when I've just invented a new genre, or system, or game mechanic which I've never seen before. 

I'm also at my best if I get to work on _many skills simultaneously_. That's why I've made more (video) games than anything else: it combines programming, design, music and writing all in a single project.

As such, progress on a project won't be linear.

* First, there's a stage in which I try out _everything_ and _experiment_.
* Then we must have the patience to wait until this yields creative, unique and strong results.
* With this strong foundation, the actual progress towards the finish line naturally becomes more of a _sprint_.

Even after _many_ completed games, I still can't predict the future. If you try to go somewhere in a straight and predictable line, the project will become _bad and unoriginal_.

So I take my time. I try things that might seem "silly" beforehand. I rapidly go through five versions, where no idea is too crazy. But I also solve problems by going outdoors, exercising, getting a good night's sleep, and tackling it again two days later.

Hopefully, the endless list of published projects is enough "proof" that you can trust me on this. That things _will_ be finished and I _do_ have the experience to pull something off.
