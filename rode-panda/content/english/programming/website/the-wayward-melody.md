This is my **huge online store** that sells everything I make. It's by far my biggest project and the most important source of income. And it's the best website of all that I've made, if I may say so myself.

The website is 100% **designed and run by me**. I wanted to learn how to make an online store and everything it entails. I needed a place to actually sell my work, instead of giving it all away for free. Because sharing everything for free left me with no income, which is another reason why I _had_ to make the whole system myself and keep it as small/efficient as possible.

The website contains **all my work** (old and new) spread over 7 different main categories. My older work is of lesser quality and not specifically made for the store, so most of it is free. Newer work made for the store has a sensible price tag and more refinement and marketing behind them.

The website has a clear **educational perspective**. I've always been interested in improving our massively flawed systems of education. After all those years, I thought the time was ripe to design my own worksheets, quizzes, puzzles, and more to aid education and learning. The "core category" aligns quite closely with an actual school curriculum and its rules. All the other categories, however, deviate more and more so that I can make e.g. educational games or educational escape rooms.

Most of all, this online store is basically the **final boss of this portfolio**! It's the culmination of everything I've learned and everything I've done. All those different skills that I honed by building earlier websites and products were put to use here. In a way, making a massive ambitious online store became almost "boring" because I already knew what to do at every twist and turn. But that's fine, because, for the first time in my life, I'm actually earning an income as an artist.

NOTE: In due time, this portfolio will propably disappear, replaced by the online store. Because all my projects will be _there_, connected and categorized cleanly, and presented in a way such that you can actually see or buy the project itself.
