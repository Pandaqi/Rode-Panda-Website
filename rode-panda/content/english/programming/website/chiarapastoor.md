My sister is an artist as well. I designed her website and portfolio. (Many different versions, actually, over the years.)

Of course this wasn't some official project. If you need a website, and your little brother builds websites as a career, then your problem is solved rather quickly :p 

The idea/visual design is completely her own (she's a visual artist, after all), I just coded it and made her idea a functional website.
