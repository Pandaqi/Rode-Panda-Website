When I was 11, I taught myself how to program. That eventful day has lead to 10+ years of developing games.

Which has led to starting a professional game studio and making a career out of it: Pandaqi Games.

This website contains all my (finished) games, including screenshots, images, and other fun stuff. 

It was made specifically to
* Better showcase my games. (With unique graphics, design, fonts, etcetera for each release.)
* Be a central hub for all my games. (As they used to be spread across many different platforms.)
* Demonstrate my philosophy, personality, on which platforms you can reach/follow me, and why I only develop local multiplayer games.

Some of my boardgames have a digital component &mdash; this website also handles that.
