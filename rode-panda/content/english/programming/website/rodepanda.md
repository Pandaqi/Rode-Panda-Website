Of course, I designed and programmed this website myself!

This is actually "version 2" of the portfolio. It borrows the good elements from v1, but made some huge changes.

The biggest changes were: 
* A custom font (the header font) I designed myself => wanted to do it for version 1, ran out of time
* A grid on the front page => draws the eye, better overview of all my work, easy to pick one you like
* Much more diversity in colors and graphics => just looks better and more playful
* Much less text and navigation => the old version had _loads_ of explanations and bits of text for each page, project, subcategory, you name it
* Switched to a _static_ website under the hood => much faster, easier to maintain, the future of the internet (in my humble opinion)

This article explains the changes and development **in Dutch**:
* [Hoe ik mijn portfolio heb verbeterd (Rode Panda)](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/gewoon-een-gedachte/hoe-ik-mijn-portfolio-heb-verbeterd)

These articles talk about "version 1" (how I designed it, the idea behind it, etc.) in Dutch:
* [Grafisch Ontwerp ("Rode Panda")](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/typische-tekeningen/grafisch-ontwerp-rode-panda/)
* [Logo Design ("Rode Panda")](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/typische-tekeningen/logo-ontwerp-rode-panda/)

As the articles show, I had many ideas/mockups for the website. But the design I chose just had the best "nature" and "red panda" vibe to it. It was the most playful and vibrant. (As much as I love a good, clean, modern looking design ... it just doesn't fit my personality and my projects.)

Besides that, I love a good challenge. This website&mdash;with the many visual elements, responsive grids, custom fonts&mdash;was certainly a challenge.
