_Bamboo_ (or _Pandaqi Bamboo_) is my own coding language. I developed it to use in my programming tutorials, especially the introductory [Learn to Code](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/programming/learn-to-code/).

Why? 

* There aren't many existing languages that you can easily execute right in the browser. And I didn't want to tell readers to install or setup something (complicated)
* The languages I was left with, contained too many syntax or concepts to explain to _complete beginners_
* So I decided to create my own simple language on top of JavaScript.

The language was supposed to ...

* Read just like simple English sentences
* Only support what's absolutely needed
* Both write, syntax highlight _and_ execute (fast) inside your browser
* Nudge people towards _good_ coding habits (by simply not allowing the bad habits)

This turned into a huge journey into how programming languages work and how to create your own. The end result? Bamboo.

I'm very proud of it. I also realize it's a very small and limited language, with an implementation full of inefficient code. Because, well, it was the first programming language I ever created :)

But it suits its purpose. It allowed me to make that course very _interactive_, because it's full of small examples you can immediately change and play with. It also allowed me to teach coding _without_ introducing complicated or overwhelming symbols.

You can read a summary of the full journey [in my Bamboo devlog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/news-and-updates/bamboo-my-own-coding-language/).
