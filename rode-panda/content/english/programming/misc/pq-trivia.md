**PQ Trivia** is a **quiz system** that I developed. It allows you to write your own fun questions in a simple text file, with no other restrictions or prerequisites. When done, you simply throw that file into the system, and voilà: you get a nice digital quiz to play in your browser.

You can use this, for example, to ask all players to send in their own 5 questions. Now you can still play the quiz together by simply throwing all those text files into the system, without looking at them.

The system can even turn your quiz into a physical (printable) version, or display images/audio/video in both questions and answers, and much more!

It started long ago as a tiny tool for a "New Year's Eve Quiz" at home. The quiz was mostly on paper, but the screen could show some special questions and images. Once I saw how useful it was, I added more functionality. Make the entire quiz playable digitally, add printable answer sheets tailored to it, add interactive media, allow different question types, etcetera.

Once I started work on my online store, I suddenly realized that I could sell quizzes too! This accelerated the development of this system, making it the first big framework I completed (for the store).

When that store launched, I finished "version 1.0" of this system and made it public. Anyone can use the system and read/use its code freely! It's never "done", of course. But the current version is overflowing with functionality and has been tested in practice by the many quizzes I made for sale, which is why I don't expect massive changes here anymore.
