_Art Hockey_ is a fun mobile game for 1&ndash;4 players about scoring goals (and defending your own goal) by drawing!

## What's special about this project?
I could barely find any mobile games that allowed local multiplayer (multiple people on the same phone), and even fewer that allowed up to 4 players. 

So I wanted to create that and see if it's possible. The result? Yes it's possible! And it's even a lot of fun! (Although I've certainly refined the ideas in later projects.)

On top of that, I wanted to test a new game engine (Solar2D) and practice more with cool Artificial Intelligence methods. I wrote about my experiences on my blog:
