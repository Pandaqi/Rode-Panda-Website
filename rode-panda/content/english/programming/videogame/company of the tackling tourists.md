_Company of the Tackling Tourists_ is a local multiplayer partygame about leading tourists to all the beautiful landmarks. 

Before they are tackled off the map. Or eaten by a crocodile. Or sacrificed by _you_ to gain some speed.

The idea is really strong and fun. But being the first really big game I made, it has its flaws. A sequel might be developed in the future. 

## What's special?
This was my first big local multiplayer game. All projects before it were much smaller in scope and usually released for free.

I finished 99% of the project ... and then put it away. Some things just didn't feel right. It didn't seem to live up to its potential.

So, in the mean time, I released some mid-sized local multiplayer games. For example, _Rolling in the Sheepe_. 

I learnt a lot from those releases. I waited until I felt ready to finish this game 100% and give it the release it deserved.

The major improvements in this game are
- **Less is more**: early versions had multiple buttons per player. The final version only has _movement_ and _one button_, which anyone can learn in five seconds.
- **Say _why?_ to UI**: early versions had tons of text and icons in the different corners for different players. A big rewrite was able to remove all of this and clean it up.
- **New tutorial system**: when you start a level, it displays _cards_. Flip them and they reveal a new bit of information to learn. As such, you learn everything right when you need it, no sooner nor later.
