_Own Goals Not Allowed_ is a local multiplayer game (for 1&ndash;6 players) about playing a (very) simple version of soccer ... on multiple fields at the same time. And accidentally own goaling is BAD.

When you press **up**, for example, your character goes up in _all fields_. There can be 1&ndash;4 fields at any given moment, with randomly sized goals, powerups, balls, other players. So making a heroic save in one location ... might just lead to a silly own goal in another.

## What's special?
This was my first "weekend project". An idea so small and simple I could never work on it much longer, nor sell the game or do anything more with it. But still a good idea that I really wanted to make.

So I did. I ended up requiring nearly 4 days, but hey, that's to be expected with software projects.

The game ended up much better than I could've wished for. Because it's so simple, anyone can play, and I even managed to add computer players that are decent.

And when you score an own goal ... in the most silly way possible ... that's just a sure recipe for laughter all around.
