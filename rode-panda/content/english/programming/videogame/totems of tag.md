_Totems of Tag_ is a video game for 2&ndash;4 players on the same device. It's basically the game of dodgeball ... but with absolutely all rules removed, and many powerups and variations added.

Visit my blog to read a [devlog ("what I've learned")](https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-totems-of-tag) about this game.

## What's special?
This game has no tutorial. Because the concept of dodgeball is so simple and well-known (grab a ball, throw it against an opponent), there's not much to explain.

The only thing that needs explaining are which _buttons_ to press. But that simply happens when you start the game for the first time: a bubble appears above your head that shows you what to do.

When testing, this really made a difference. People were playing _so much faster_ and clicked with it _so much more_, that it convinced me to never do any upfront tutorials or explanations again.

## What's even more special?
This game was noticed by an online gaming platform (POKI). I ended up porting the game to their system, learning a lot during the process, making the game better and more accessible.

It was the first time I made a _web game_, supported by _ads_, as contracted work for a big gaming website.
