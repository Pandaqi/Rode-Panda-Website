_Worlds We Used to Own_ (WWUTO) is an RTS (real time strategy) game about many different animal factions trying to reclaim as much of the world ( = their territory) as possible.

During development I kept an active devlog on Tumblr, which has sadly been removed for reasons unknown to me. (Yes, it was a mistake to keep it there. Now I keep devlogs from my own blog.)

The game is made with _LÃ–VE_ (Love2D), which uses the coding language _Lua_. All systems and graphics have been made from scratch by me.

The game concept and execution were really promising ... but unfortunately, I had to quit development. It was just too big for me at the time and I didn't see a way to generate income with the game in the short term.
