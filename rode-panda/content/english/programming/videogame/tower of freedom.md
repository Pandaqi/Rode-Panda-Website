_Tower of Freedom_ is a video game I developed in my spare time (at university).

Everything was made by me: the game idea, the graphics, the code, the music, et cetera. 

This game was made with Godot Engine. It got me a job as co-writer on a book about Godot and the game has been featured in the Godot Showcase. Most importantly: friends and family had fun playing this game. I must have done something right?

I used to often play silly multiplayer games with a friend of mine (at university). One day, we were sad because we just couldn't find any good (local) multiplayer games. That's when we decided to make our own! (And, if we're being honest, that's why this game is much better in multiplayer mode than in single player.)
