_Bellyboinkers_ is a local multiplayer partygame about boinking your opponents off the field with your belly!

The premise is extremely simple and intuitive, which is what makes this game so accessible and great for groups. You only need to learn one button for movement (and maybe one for jumping). Then you can play an endless variety of arenas, characters, game modes, etcetera.

Visit my blog to read a very detailed [devlog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/devlog-bellyboinkers) about the development of this game.

## What's special?

This is my biggest and most succesful game so far. It's the first game that I sold for a price above 10 euros, which I think is absolutely fair given the quality and content. 

I worked on it a long time, improved on all mistakes/oversights in previous projects, and tested the game early and often.

Even the first version, without proper 3D models, with many bugs or systems still missing, was enjoyed immensely by my testers. When we agreed to play 30 minutes, they played 2 hours, laughing the whole time.

This motivated me to give everything to make this game a reality and make it as good as such a simple premise can be.

(For example: there's literally no other way to die than _falling off the field_. Not in the advanced arenas, not when you add powerups: the _core_ never changes. Some might see this as a bad thing, but I know it's a good thing and it was really hard to keep this promise to myself. This makes the game very consistent, removes any learning curve or annoying downtime, and allows even kids or non-gamers to play all of it.)

I also invented an "expansion" system. This allowed me to get the _base game_ out very quickly, with about 15 levels to play. But over time, I could easily add more content in the form of "expansion packs" that you can buy for a low price.

It seems like a trick to get more money, but I've learned this system is extremely fair and useful for both the developer and the player. I can publish content quicker and easier, or stop working further on the game if nobody's interested anymore. Players can only buy the things they want for a low price, without being required to pay 30 euros to get _everything_ at once.
