_All the Stars in the Universe_ is an experiment on randomly generating ALL the art in a game, pixel art style.

It's an HTML5 game, which means it's made with website code and any browser should be able to play it without problems. (Specifically, the [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io) library was used.)

The game can be played here on itch.io, which is also the official page for it.

Many core mechanics are finished. (A random universe is generated, it looks good, you can hop between planets, enter houses, shoot at meteors, collect star dust, etc.) 

But it's an experiment, nothing more. I realized I was more excited about trying something new and innovative, and had no desire to turn it into a full game. (The plan was to make it a "simple game about traveling through the galaxy as a star thief, for love".)
