_Hack Battle_ is a puzzle game about cracking codes. You can play it alone, but the preferred way is to play against someone else. Hence the name "hack _battle_"!

A random map is generated with **blocks** connected by **wires**. Each wire starts with a certain signal (ON or OFF) and ends in the password location, where _you_ need to guess their final value.

Obviously, the blocks change the signal along the way. Maybe they invert it: ON becomes OFF, and vice versa. Or they only output the first signal they receive. Or they output what the _majority_ of signals is saying.

The player that can think more quickly and logically than the other, will solve the code first!

Visit my blog to read a [devlog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-hack-battle) about the development of this game.

## What's special?
This was my _second_ "weekend project". Again, I wasn't able to fully create it in a weekend, and had to take 4 days.

Mostly because I saw the idea had more potential than I thought. Instead of "ON/OFF", we could make codes from _numbers_ or _shapes_. Instead of playing with two, I could allow playing with 1&ndash;4, also on non-mobile devices.

This inflated the idea a bit, but I decided to allow it, as I got a _set_ of games out of it that I quite enjoy and are differnt from anything else I've made :)
