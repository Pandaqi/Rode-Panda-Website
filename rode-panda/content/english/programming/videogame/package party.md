_Package Party_ is a chaotic multiplayer game for 1&ndash;4 players! 

I made the game for literally anyone, gamers and non-gamers alike, because I just wanted families/friends/partners to play more games together.

To make it appealing and accessible to _anyone_, the core idea is simple: _deliver packages_ (as fast and good as you can). 

Obviously, that would grow boring quick, so each level would add new elements. (Special packages, changing environments, new rules/controls, etcetera.)

This game is currently my only _unfinished_ professional project. (It has its first 13 levels, but nothing after that.)

It was always intended as a professional game release and it _will_ be made! During development, however, I realized I needed more funds and a larger team. That's the reason it's currently on pause mode.
