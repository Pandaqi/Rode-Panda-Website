_Pizza Peers_ is a cooperative game about delivering pizzas. 

It's a hilarious dance between collecting ingredients, inventing new pizza combinations, baking until just right, and delivering them just on time.

It is part of [The Peerful Project](/en/programming/videogame/the-peerful-project). (In fact, it's the very first game.) This is a collection of multiplayer games, in which each player uses their _smartphone_ to play.
