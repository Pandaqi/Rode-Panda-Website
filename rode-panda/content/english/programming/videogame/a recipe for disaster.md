_A Recipe for Disaster_ is a cooperative video game for 1&ndash;4 players on the same device, in which you try to run a bakery! (But you can only move around ... and throw ingredients.)

Visit my blog to read a [devlog ("what I've learned")](https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/one-week-games/devlog-a-recipe-for-disaster) about this game.

## What's special?
This game was made as part of a (self-imposed) "one week game" challenge. I did this to force myself to keep the project small and contained, and ensure I release something fun within a week.

It turned out to be such a success that I made many more "one week games" afterwards! This game has 20 levels, each adding something new (which means it still received a surprising amount of content), and is just plain fun.

At the official page, you can also find more information &mdash; such as trailers and screenshots &mdash; how I made it, and why I gave myself this challenge.

## What's even more special?
This game was noticed by an online gaming platform (POKI). I ported the game to their system, together with another one of my "one week games" called _Totems of Tag_. (Although by that time, they completely stopped being "one week", of course.)

It was the first time I made a _web game_, supported by _ads_, as contracted work for a big gaming website.
