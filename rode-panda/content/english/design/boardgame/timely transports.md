_Timely Transports_ is a [One Paper Game](/en/design/boardgame/one-paper-games) about delivering goods across a perilous jungle ... in real-time.

Visit my blog to read [in-depth developer diaries](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/timely-transports) about this game.

## How does it work?
You play on a physical board, on which everyone simultaneously moves their vehicles and goods.

Every time you move, however, you start a timer on your phone. You must wait until the timer finishes before finishing the movement. And if your attention slips away for a second ... the timer runs out and you get a penalty!

I don't know why nobody else is making these kinds of games. There are _so many_ things a smartphone can do that would be impossible in regular boardgames, and this is a prime example of it.

## What's special about this project?
Three words: _randomly generated boards_

If you go the website, you can click a button to _generate a whole new world_

Like this one:

Or, if you want to use less ink or print black-and-white:

If you get bored of your current map, you can just print a new one, which is programmed to look good and be balanced.

Again, I don't know why nobody else is exploring this. It's awesome!
