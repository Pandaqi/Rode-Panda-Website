_Six of Sparrows_ is a simple game that combines the pattern-matching of poker with a simpler game loop and tense bidding instead of bluffing. In this game, much less material is needed, nobody needs to remember all those combinations (and which scores higher), and even the worst hand can end up scoring the most points.

## What's special?

This is kind of a "twin game" with [Bidding Blocks](/design/boardgame/bidding-blocks/). They started from the same inspiration and idea (such as the classic card game Tichu), then I decided to _split_ them on purpose. Because two small, simple, fun games is far better than one bloated, convoluted one ;)
