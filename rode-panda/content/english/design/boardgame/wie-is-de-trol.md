In the Netherlands, there's a TV programma called _Who is the Mole?_

It pits 10 candidates against each other, trying to complete challenges (for money) ... but one is the "mole" who tries to secretly sabotage everything.

This game is a boardgame variant on this programme, which hopefully captures the spirit and fun of the original. As the programme is only available here, it is my only game that's _exclusively Dutch_. Sorry.
