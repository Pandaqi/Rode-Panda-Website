_Unstable Universe_ is the first _cutting game_ ever made! (As far as I can tell.) It's a [One Paper Game](/en/design/boardgame/one-paper-games).

Any time you want to play, visit the website, generate a random board, and print it. Like this one:

Visit my blog to read [in-depth developer diaries](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/unstable-universe) about this game.

## What's special?
_Cutting_ is the major element in this game. 

As you try to be the first to reach the center, you may regularly perform a "cutting action", with which you can strategically remove other players from the board.

As this is a _One Paper Game_, you simply print a new board every time you want to play. So yes, cutting means literally _cutting_ into that paper. (When the game is done, you don't need it anymore anyway.)

After many tries (and failures) I'm happy I finally made this innovative idea work! And it turned out to be a fun and interesting game.

Within a few games, this one quickly became a favourite among my test players. Because, let's be real, how often are you allowed to cut a game board in frustration when you're losing a game?
