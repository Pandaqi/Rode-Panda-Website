_Photomone: Digital Antists_ is a spin-off for my family drawing game [Photomone](/en/design/boardgame/photomone). 

What's the difference? This one is completely digital! You play it by simply visiting the website on a smartphone or tablet. (No rules to read, nothing to print, no physical material. It's a mix between a board game and a video game.)

This forced me to simplify the game even further, but also opened up other opportunities. For example, I was able to add some mechanics that are quite complex, because the _computer_ could handle that---and players didn't need to learn how they work.

## What's special?

This is the first time I've created a fully digital spin-off for a project that was originally a board game. It's a very strange project: it's completely digital, but it doesn't _feel_ like a video game or mobile game. 

Maybe because it's a website. Maybe because you play by _drawing_ on your screen (just like drawing on paper in the original Photomone). In a sense, your phone _becomes_ the board of a board game :)
