_Starry Skylines_ is a [One Paper Game](/en/design/boardgame/one-paper-games) about building a city in space.

The problem? You don't know which options you'll get each round, and everyone shares the same (uncomfortably small) planet.

Here's a picture of some finished games within the same campaign:

## What's special?

This game eventually turned out _gigantic_ with
* Over 100 unique buildings that could appear
* 8 planets to play (as you can see in the logo)
* And almost 100 unique events

Due to its size, it's not my most polished or streamlined game. But I surely learned a lot. And many people around me actually pick this game when I ask: "what's your favourite out of all my games?"
