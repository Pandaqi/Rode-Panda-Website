_Swerving Shots_ is a boardgame in which you play cowboys trying to shoot each other simultaneously.

Everything was made by me: the idea, the designs, the cards/tiles, the rules, et cetera.

This game is a sort of "spiritual successor" to one of my early games. I think that's why the game turned out well&mdash;I already had experience with this genre and the mechanics. It's simple, it works, every game is different, and everyone I played with had fun. What more could you wish for?

(Well, to be honest, there is a lot to wish for, as it's still one of my earliest designs.)
