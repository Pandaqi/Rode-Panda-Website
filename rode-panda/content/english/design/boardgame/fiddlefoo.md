_Fiddlefoo_ is a simple game about getting rid of your cards first. Every turn, people must play a card that creates a same-color pair on the map, such as a Red 2 and a Red 7. Then ... the other players may throw any cards at you with a number _within_ that range (such as a Red 4)!

It's your job to strategically throw your worst/hardest cards at other players when allowed and make sure nobody can give you penalty cards on your turn.

## What's special?

This is one of my tiny in-between games. There's nothing really special about it---it was just a little idea that I wanted to make while I worked on other, bigger projects. I guess the most special thing is that the idea is quite heavily inspired by an existing game (called _Cabanga!_). Which I usually don't do, because I, like most creatives, want to be _completely original_ and do things _never done before_!

That said, I think the design is vibrant and colorful, and the theme of musical instruments and music notes is cute and unique.
