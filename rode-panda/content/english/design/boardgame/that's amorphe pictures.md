_That's Amorphe: Pictures_ is an accessible, fun party game about drawing two things at the same time. It's a spin-off of the successful [That's Amorphe](/en/design/thats-amorphe).

On your turn, you get a random word and draw it. Then you swap drawings with your teammate. You get another _secret_ word and must change the drawing before you towards that secret thing! But not all the way---only some amount. 

Maybe you need to morph a drawing of a cat halfway into a house. Maybe a drawing of a tree needs to turn into a giraffe ... by a _little_ bit. The other players then have to guess what your secret amount was.

If I'm honest, it's a better implementation of the original idea. Using the lessons learned from the base game, I was able to improve some rules and simplify it even further. Besides, drawing is just more intuitive for many people than coming up with words.

Visit my blog to read [the developer diary](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/thats-amorphe-pictures). It explains how I designed this game and the different versions through which it went.

## What's special?

All the same things as the original!

* It's powered by my own dictionary tool that supplies common English words.
