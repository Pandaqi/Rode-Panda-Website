_Keebble Domino_ is a spin-off of my fun word game [Keebble](/en/design/keebble). It's actually the second one, completing the trilogy of word games. 

## What's special?

I created my own "font" for this game. Why? Because dominos can be placed in any orientation, which would normally cause letters to be upside-down and oriented the wrong way all the time. It's probably why no other word game exists that uses dominoes.

What to do? Invent a set of symbols that look like (different) letters _no matter how you look at them_. It's called an ambigram: a piece of text that is still a piece of text when you mirror / rotate / reflect it.

That's why this was the last spin-off for Keebble to get made. I had to figure out that font. I had to figure out if it could even work!

Besides that, these dominoes can be generated by my website, creating unique games for everyone. But that's not so special anymore---I already used that in many games before this one.
