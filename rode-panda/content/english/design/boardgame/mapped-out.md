In most board games, the map is decided before hand (printed on cardboard), and it's about moving your pawn to the best locations or with the best route. So I decided: why not turn that on its head?

In _Mapped Out_, you get your route at the start of the game. A bunch of cards that say you're going left, then right, then up, and so forth. During the game, you have to design the _map_ to make the most of that predetermined journey.

## What's special?

Nothing, really. Just a solid core idea that I decided to execute on, using all the knowledge (and code/assets) I'd gained from previous games. I kept it simpler than I usually do---also a lesson learned---which made development fast but unremarkable.
