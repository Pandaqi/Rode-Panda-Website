_Nine Lives_ is a fast (party) card game about being a cat trying to NOT lose your lives.

Each round, you take turns playing a single card, building a collection of cats on the table. If you can't play a card anymore, you lose a life. 

But that's not the end. You may _wager_ lives to gain a temporary ability to survive this round. If you still lose, however, you lose all the lives you wagered as well!

## What's special?

The core idea of this game is extremely simple and effective:
* Don't be the first to lose all your lives.
* Losing a round makes you lose a life. (You can't play a card if that specific cat already appears 9 times.)
* But you can wager lives (a risk-reward thing) to try and stay alive a little longer. (And hope somebody else loses before your next turn.)

The game is explained in a minute, but gives real strategy and tension for half an hour.

That's why this idea eventually turned into _three versions_, adding [Nine Lives: Math Meows](/en/design/boardgame/nine-lives-math-meows) and [Nine Lives: Tricksy Kittens](/en/design/boardgame/nine-lives-tricksy-kittens). I call the other two versions spin-offs, because they're not sequels or expansions, but rather a standalone game with the same theme and core mechanic.

The game is also **textless**. Powers and cats are simple icons. This simplicity and friendliness to kids is why I deemed _this version_ the base game. (The other versions, for example, have numbers on the cards and textual powers.)

Going forward, I try to achieve this more and more. I guess my younger self just didn't realize the average age at which kids learn to read. Many of my older games are very kid-friendly ... if it weren't for the text or (difficult) numbers.

Finally, these games are part of an ongoing series: simple fast card games in which one specific _number_ is important for everything. After [Sixpack](/en/design/boardgame/sixpack), we now have Nine Lives. I like such elegant and minimal games that share a common theme---perhaps I'm a mathematician after all. (Though this series has no concrete name or endgoal yet.)
