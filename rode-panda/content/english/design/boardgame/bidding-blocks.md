_Bidding Blocks_ is a simple game that combines trick-taking (with a twist) with a simple bidding mechanic at the start to create magic. Or, judging by the theme, a house with lots of floors, no walls, and multiple roofs.

## What's special?

This is kind of a "twin game" with [Six of Sparrows](/design/boardgame/six-of-sparrows/). They started from the same inspiration and idea (such as the classic card game Tichu), then I decided to _split_ them on purpose. Because two small, simple, fun games is far better than one bloated, convoluted one ;)
