_Nine Lives: Math Meows_ is a fast card game about being a cat trying to NOT lose your lives.

Each round, you take turns playing a single card. There's only one rule: you can't play a number already on the table. If this means you can't play a card anymore, you lose a life. 

But that's not the end. You may _wager_ a life, which allows you to play _multiple cards_ as one number. If you still end up losing the round, however, you lose all lives wagered too!

## What's special?

As expected, this is a spin-off for the original [Nine Lives](/en/design/boardgame/nine-lives). 

What's different? It uses numbers, permanent powers (instead of one-time powers you get when wagering), and specific "cats" you can play (with their specific set of 9 lives).

As I'm a mathematician, this version was the easiest to make and balance, and therefore was actually finished first. Sure, the math is very easy, but I still deem this a slightly more complex version of the game. Because the power of your current Life Card is active at all times, there can be a lot going on in certain rounds. (For example, if it says "Nobody may play a 6", then it's easy to forget that for a hot second once you're 10+ turns into a round.)

But that's why I make these spin-offs. Most ideas can be executed in multiple ways, each with their advantages and disadvantages. This version has more possibilities than the base game, for example, if you're willing to play a bit risky.

I've learned that it's best to split those ideas into separate standalone projects, instead of cramming it into a single game which ends up achieving nothing. (That would be like writing a book in 5 different genres, appealing to fans of none.)
