_The Saint Nicholas Games_ are two small games that I purposely made to be played during the holiday of Saint Nicholas. This is a typical Dutch holiday that is most likely the origin of Christmas.

Of course, you can play these games at any time! But their themeing heavily leans on Saint Nicholas, and the games are designed for families and large groups (with players who might normally never play a board game).

The rules are extremely simple and meant to support large player counts. The simplest game of the two has no necessary text, to also allow the youngest children to play, and even supports simultaneous turns to make sure nobody needs to wait their turn.

_These games are, as expected, only available in Dutch. Sorry._

## What's special?

This project started as _one game_ that was a standalone spinoff within my _Naivigation_ series. Those are simple games in which you try to steer the same vehicle ... _together_. From there, it was easy to make the jump to the following thought: "But wait, the steam engine with which Saint Nicholas arrives each year is _also_ a vehicle!"

During development, however, the idea turned out to be two ideas. And so the game split into two unique games. One of them extremely simple, the other one pretty simple, but both built upon the idea of _moving a vehicle together_ to _make Saint Nicholas a success_.

I'm proud of the fact that I keep learning new ways to make my games _even simpler_. I don't even need text or numbers anymore in some cases. When I made _Boot op Stoom_ (the "harder version"), I thought it couldn't be simplified further. But two days and two iterations later, I suddenly saw the obvious way in which _Amerigo's Dakenpad_ could be even simpler to teach and play.

Besides _Wie is de Trol?_ (which is based on a popular Dutch TV show), these are my only Dutch board games. Because, well, the holiday of Saint Nicholas---at least in the way we celebrate it---is found nowhere else in the world.

(It's likely I'll make a Christmas version of these too, at some point. That will be English and more focused on the lore and familiar elements of that holiday, of course.)
