_One Paper Games_ are a new kind of boardgame I've invented. (I don't know if you can call it a new _genre_, but I haven't seen anything like it before.)

The idea is simple. Each time you want to play, print a single paper and grab a pen! It's literally a _full game_, which is played with a single piece of paper. (Usually by players writing on it.)

The idea has clear benefits over (traditional) games:
* It's extremely quick to setup or clean up
* It's cheap. (Only need to grab or print a piece of paper + pens, of which people usually have an abundance.)
* It easily supports few or many players.
* It can be easily paused, taken with you when traveling, explained to others, folded.
* It opens up loads of opportunities. (Which I have, obviously, started exploring.)

The downside is, of course, that it doesn't feel or look as nice as a boardgame with nice (wooden) components. And some things are _not_ possible in this format, such as card games, or bigger games.
