_Keebble Knickknack_ is a spin-off of my fun word game [Keebble](/en/design/keebble). Same easy rules inspired by Scrabble, same ideas, but now supercharged because it's a **hybrid game**!

That means you play on a physical paper (like a board game), but also use my website on one device (like a phone) while playing. The device handles a lot for you, making the game much faster to setup, explain and play. It also opens new opportunities that wouldn't be possible without a digital component.

Visit my blog to read [the developer diary](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/keebble-knickknack) explaining how I designed this game.

## What's special?

Same as the original game---and a bit more.

* Interactive Rules: I've refined my invention of _interactive rulebooks_ further. It's still barebones, but already much nicer than traditional rulebooks if you ask me.
* Pandaqi Words: my dictionary tool that can help decide whether something is a word or not.
* The hybrid component: it's basically a small, free game right within the website. Without any hassle, it allows games like these to be played and enjoyed by anyone with _some_ semblance of a smartphone and Wi-Fi.
