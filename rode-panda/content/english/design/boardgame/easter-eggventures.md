_Easter Eggventures_ is a collection of simple family games themed around Easter. Besides a shared theme and visual style, the games are all completely unique. They use simple rules and material to simulate something resembling an egg hunt, such as a _reverse_ egg hunt or one where only a specific _secret egg_ scores you points.

The project contains these 5 games:

* [Bunny Bidding](https://pandaqi.com/easter-eggventures/play/bunny-bidding/): snatch the best offers containing the one secret egg that scores you points.
* [Egghunt Esports](https://pandaqi.com/easter-eggventures/play/egghunt-esports/): find the locations of the best eggs and collect them, but without ever entering the arena or giving that info away to your opponents.
* [Reggverse Riddles](https://pandaqi.com/easter-eggventures/play/reggverse-riddles/): win the reverse egg hunt by cleverly changing where eggs are hidden just before you decide to look.
* [Chicken Colorout](https://pandaqi.com/easter-eggventures/play/chicken-colorout/): be the first to hide all your eggs in an environment filled with kids (or other forces) eager to find them again.
* [Quizhide Queaster](https://pandaqi.com/easter-eggventures/play/quizhide-queaster): one team hides the eggs, the other searches, but communication between them is unfortunately limited to vague, dreamlike illustrations.

## What's special?

I regularly design board games around holidays, because it's _the_ time people play games with the family (which is also true for my family) and it provides a nice _deadline_ for finishing that game.

And so I once wrote down ideas for an Easter game. I ended up with only a single idea that I thought was mediocre.

When I came back months later, I took the time to really brainstorm better ideas---and I suddenly ended up with too many of them!

As expected, I made them all and put them under a shared banner.

This was the first time I've made multiple ideas (that were supposed to be the same idea or the same project) alongside each other, actually finished them all, and decided they were good enough to release as one major project at once.

I also did this while being incredibly sick. For nearly two months, leading up to Easter, I was struck by a virus that just would not go away. As such, I half expect there to still be silly mistakes here and there within the project, because my mind wasn't completely on the task.

(If I hadn't fallen this ill, for this long, this project probably would not exist. I would not have been forced to pause my actual work and allow fumbling around with these Easter boardgame ideas for a few weeks.)
