_Paper Thieves_ is the very first game I designed for my collection of [One Paper Games](/en/design/one-paper-games)

The game is played on a single piece of paper, with players taking moves by writing their symbol/action on the paper.

Everyone plays a notorious criminal. To win, you need to be the first to gather X treasures and flee the city! (Where X depends on player count.)

It's not that easy, of course. Symbols from other players will block your path, and if anyone thinks you're becoming too wealthy ... they might just send the police your way.

## What's special about this project?
It was my first experiment with _One Paper Games_. 

Without it, I would have never made all the others. Nor learned important lessons about _how_ to make those kinds of games.
