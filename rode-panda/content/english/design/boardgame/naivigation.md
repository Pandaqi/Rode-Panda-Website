_Naivigation_ is a cooperative boardgame in which you try to steer a single car ... together.

At this link you'll find all files to download, which are the rules and designs for the game, and a developer diary about the development process.

As usual, everything was made by my from scratch: the designs, the cards/tiles, the rules, etc. This game taught me a lot about creating clear card designs and simplifying rules.

It was also my first boardgame that just _clicked_ with people around me. Even the earliest version was a lot of fun and easy to play/get into for my friends and family. 

Because of the succes of the first version, I'm planning to overhaul the game (with the lessons I learned later), and add expansions.
