_Sleighwell_ is a cooperative game about delivering Christmas presents to the right houses.

Each turn, you either **play a tile** (from your hand), or **move the sleigh**.

Tiles must be played in numerical order. For example, if the row already has 2 and 5, you can't play something _between_ those numbers.

When you move the sleigh, it removes all tiles that it passes. But if you land on a house ... and you removed all the right presents ... you score the house!

This very simple mechanic really gives the feeling of flying around in a sleigh and racing to deliver everything, together. This being a cooperative game, I'd say it's perfect to play with your family at Christmas.

## What's special?

To my own surprise, this is my first pure tile-laying game, and one of the first cooperative games. Somehow, all my ideas for such games previously didn't work or weren't finished. 

Perhaps the holiday theme---and my race to finish it before Christmas---helped bring it home. (I published the game a full year later, so I had time to properly test and polish it further.)

It showed me why I should make more tile-based games. They require fewer material, fewer code/design on my end, while opening a world of possibilities. (If you add the right ruleset on top.)

I think the game works so well because its core rules are inherently balanced.

* The "play" action adds tiles, the "sleigh" action removes them.
* You need more tiles to maneuver the sleigh and get enough presents, but more tiles also restricts the numbers you _can_ play.

Of course, the cooperative nature quickly turns into cheating as players _strongly hint_ towards which numbers they hold, but that's just part of the fun ;)
