_Slippery Slopes: Trippy Touches_ is a digital version of my game [Slippery Slopes](/en/design/boardgame/slippery-slopes).

While making the original game, I realized I was already 80% towards a completely digital version. (The printable cards for this game are generated by the website, so I already had code that could randomly generate the necessary components.)

So I thought: why not go the full 100% and release a version of this game you can play with one smartphone and nothing else?

That's all. For more information, check the original game.
