_Photomone_ is a simple, fun, fast party game about communicating words by drawing. But you're ants and can only draw by leaving a pheromone trail. 

It's one of my [One Paper Games](/en/design/boardgame/one-paper-games). The map is a paper randomly filled with dots. You can only draw using straight lines between two dots, and each word has a maximum number of lines. In other words, it's your job to somehow communicate "robot" to the other players with 12 straight lines ;)

Visit my blog to read [the developer diary](https://pandaqi.com/blog/boardgames/photomone) explaining how I designed this game.

## What's special?

The core idea---draw by connecting dots on a board with straight lines---is extremely simple, yet works wonderfully. It's not that "special", however, as it's basically a gamified version of "connect the dots". (Unsurprisingly, I got this idea when I saw somebody play a similar game.)

What _does_ make this project special? 

* The addition of some smart rules and special dots (that activate some cool powerup when used).
* The fact that you can play in three different ways: using just one paper, using traditional material (cards with secret words to hold in your hand), or using a single smartphone (where the website gives you your secret word)
* The idea was so potent that this game immediately received two spin-offs! Check out [Photomone: Digital Antists](/en/design/boardgame/photomone-digital-antists) and [Photomone: Antsassins](/en/design/boardgame/photomone-antsassins). The first one is basically a video game, the second one is a variation on the idea of the popular boardgame "Codenames".
