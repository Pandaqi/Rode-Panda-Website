_Foldigami_ is a unique game in every possible way. 

It's a **folding game**. You play using one paper (with folding lines printed on it), performing one "fold action" each turn.

It's a **truly One Paper Game**. You only need one printed paper to play. You don't even need to read a separate rules sheet (they are integrated with the board itself), or grab a pencil, or cut something with a scissor.

It's a **very quick 2-player game**, which you can play multiple times using the **same paper**.

If you know me, you can predict how this game started. I asked myself the question: "I've been making One Paper Games for a while now. But they all required something extra: rules to read, pencils to write, _something_. Can I make a truly One Paper Game?"

Foldigami is the result. And as always, creating it taught me how to do it _better_, which means more true OPGs are on the way. But this is a great start, as the game has a hidden depth that you only uncover by playing the same board multiple times. And I love the origami theme and how it looks :)
