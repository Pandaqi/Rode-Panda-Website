_The Animal Bandit_ is a fast and unique card game for all ages. It's free to download and print/play for yourself.

My core idea for this project was to create a game where you needed to "smuggle" a card off the table. In this case, it became the rare "unicorn" card that you needed to make disappear.

The catch? Before you're allowed to smuggle a card, it must first pass _all the other players_. The game became a struggle between trying to improve your own hand and getting that unicorn, and trying to bust other players by checking which card(s) are in front of you ... 

The game works and looks quite appealing, but it's not _great_ and perhaps one of my earliest/weakest creations.
