_Keebble_ answers the question: what if Scrabble could be played in 30 minutes and with just a piece of paper?

It's one of my [One Paper Games](/en/design/boardgame/one-paper-games). You place words by writing them on the paper. What makes the game work, though, are some smart rules about how you _get_ new letters and some additions I've always wanted in Scrabble.

## What's special?

**Interactive rules**. I had designed my rulebooks for _print_ (in PDF format) for years. But I'd always felt like we needed _interactive_ rules to explain games---and websites were the ideal candidate.

So I bit the bullet and decided to develop a system for interactive rules. This game was the first to use it. The idea is simply that the reader can engage with the rules:

* Open/close sections. (To prevent being overwhelmed by walls of text.)
* Cycle through examples images.
* Read on any screen size / setting
* Click a button to randomly generate an "example turn".

**Pandaqi Words**. At this time, I had several ideas for "word games". That's why I started building my own dictionary of "easy/useful English words". You can use this dictionary, on my website, to settle any debate that starts with: "that's not a word!"

Also, the website generates random starting boards. In case you don't like starting from an entirely blank paper.
