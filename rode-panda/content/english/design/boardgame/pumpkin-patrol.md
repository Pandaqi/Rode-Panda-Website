_Pumpkin Patrol_ is a Halloween-themed card game to play with your family.

During the game, you add **decorations** to your home in hopes of attracting trick-or-treaters with _very_ specific desires. But that's only half the job. Their **candy** desires are just as specific, and you only score their points if you have everything they want.

A fast card game with simple rules, which still fills the table and really sets the mood.

## What's special?

The base game was developed in only a few days, as I had to race to finish it before Halloween. (I published the game online a full year later, after working on it longer and polishing it.)

Despite that, I really like the card designs (both people and candy/decoration). The patterns, the fonts, the illustrations, it all just clicked immediately somehow.

Most of all, the game employs a unique mechanic I want to use more often: the people in the game actually walk from player to player at the end of each round. This enhances the theme (as you literally see trick-or-treaters visiting doors), but subtly allows a great deal of strategy and thinking ahead as well.

It's 100% clear and obvious where a person will go. It's still hard to _time_ their arrival well with the cards in your hand.
