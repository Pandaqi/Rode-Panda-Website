**Safarilly** (_Safari + Really?_) is a main brand for my [Dutch webshop](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl).

As expected, it focuses on **nature** and **animals**. It almost exclusively contains cute, wordless illustrations of animals and natural elements. More specifically, animals doing something that's sweet but also useless because of their natural properties. For example, a Giraffe using a ladder to reach some higher place, even though they could've easily reached it too by just stretching their neck. Hence the name: _... really!?_

The main target audience would be those with an affinity for nature or animals, with a special focus on kids/teens and those who enjoy a warm or cute look. Because there is no language at all, except perhaps the universal language of nature and silly humor, this is an international brand.

It's by far the most intensive brand, because every single design requires a new, detailed, full-color illustration of animals. Within a specific visual style, while telling a wordless joke. That's, however, also why it's one of the best-liked brands, and I think its final products often look the best.
