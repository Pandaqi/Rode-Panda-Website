**GlasHalfVol** (_English: Glass Half Full_) is a main brand for my [Dutch webshop](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl).

It focuses on relentless optimism. Glass half full versus glass half empty. The designs show situations that would otherwise be terrible, annoying, incredibly frustrating. But our main characters---all of whom are glasses and mugs---put some wildly optimistic and funny spin on it.

The main target audience would be anybody who identifies with this spirit of optimism and positive energy. Or perhaps those who _want_ more of it. For example, a surprising use of these products is to _give_ them to someone who's a bit moody and brooding, as a kind of joke slash reference to that.

This brand is currently completely in Dutch. But its main premise obviously applies in any culture or language, so it might become an international brand later.
