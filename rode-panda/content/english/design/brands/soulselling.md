**Soulselling** is the "home brand" of my Dutch webshop called "Tiamo Sells His Soul" (translated from Dutch to English).

It focuses on merchandise themed around the devil: devilish dilemmas, relatable frustrating situations, or simply the imagery and designs that go along with it. It puts a somewhat cute and colorful spin on it, as shown by the main character designs. The designs can be a bit "provocative" or "naughty", but always in a mild and harmless way.

The main target audience would be boys and men who like being slightly naughty or rebellious, without actually being devilish for real.

It's the "home brand" of the webshop because it shares its name and its what started it all, but it's certainly not the largest or bestselling brand. It's the most personal, I guess. I don't _want_ to run a webshop and commercialize my creative work---that feels like selling my soul to the devil. This brand focuses on that feeling, that identity, the hatred for our (monetary) systems or commercializing art, and I hoped like-minded people would connect with that.

_Remark: I renamed it to "Soulselling" behind the scenes purely to set it apart from the actual title of the webshop in Dutch._
