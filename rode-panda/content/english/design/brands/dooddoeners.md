**Dooddoeners** (a rough English translation would be _Clich√©/Meaningless Responses_) is a main brand for my [Dutch webshop](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl)

It focuses on commonly heard phrases (in the Netherlands) that you could use in response to _anything_ ... because they mean _nothing_. For example, "Thanks for your input", when someone says something you just don't like to hear or are never going to consider anyway. Or "I don't mean to be offensive, but ..." which is usually followed by something incredibly offensive ;) Or even "We'll stay in touch", or "Strange weather, innit?"

I strongly dislike such phrases. They waste space and energy, never actually adding anything of value, while giving people a shield to hide behind when saying stupid or harmful things. In fact, the domain name of that webshop (which was my very first "real" website) is one of those phrases: "Not that it matters, but ..."!

As such, to shine a light on them, I turn them into humorous art and merchandise!

The main target audience would be office workers who dislike such phrases too (and possibly want people to be mindful of them, to get them out of the way), or jokes between families and friends when somebody says such a phrase _a lot_.
