_El Troubadour_ (or _Tiamo, El Troubadour_) is my official artist name, applied to any music I make.

Once I had created a handful of albums, I wanted to take my music career more seriously and provide a cozy home for all my work. 

That's why I created a special website for my music. (Visit the official page.)

## What's special?
I realized (only later) that this is _the perfect project_ for me. It combines all major things I do: music, programming, design, and writing.

That's probably why I had so much fun building the website and finished/populated it very quickly.

(It also made me realize why I'm drawn to video games and have made loads of them over the years: they do this as well. They combine all these things into one project.)
