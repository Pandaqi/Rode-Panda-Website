_Pandaqi Midi_ is a tool I wrote for my tutorials website. It allowed me to show _and_ play small melody samples on my website. To see it in action, visit the [Songwriting](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/audio/songwriting) course.

It uses basic web technologies (Canvas and Web Audio) all the way through. It's a relatively simple tool, but it didn't exist yet. And it turned the tutorial from "a wall of text" into something _interactive_ and _colorful_.

How does it work?

* You simply input a melody. (By typing notes and their length, in a variety of formats. I prefer traditional format, writing it like sheet music.)
* The system visualizes it and allows you to "play" it inside the web page.

As usual, I open sourced the tool and tried to make it easy for others to use it as well.
