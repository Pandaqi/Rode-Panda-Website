_Don't Forget Me_ is my sixth singer-songwriter (mini) album.

It's a bit of a transitional album. I'd tried many different techniques and song styles on previous albums, and now I wanted to see if I could combine all that experience into something better.

That's why the songs are very diverse, from the atmospheric multi-layered voices of _Don't Forget Me_, to the upbeat folky song _Could I Be Happy Here_, to a full-on rock song in _Trip Around the World_, to a soft Waltz/ballad in _A Song for a Beautiful City_.

It's easily the biggest and most ambitious album so far. (Nicely represented by the huge amount of different tracks/layers in the project itself, nearly crashing my computer several times.)

I'm very proud of it, although I'll be the first to admit it's not perfect and I learned a few important things after releasing it and getting feedback.
