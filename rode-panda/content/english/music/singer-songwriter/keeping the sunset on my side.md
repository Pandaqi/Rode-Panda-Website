_Keeping the Sunset on my Side_ is my first singer-songwriter album. It contains 7 acoustic guitar tracks &mdash; played and sung by me &mdash; and was my first professional effort at mixing an album.

Visit the official page for the music, some background, and a more detailed diary about the development.

The album ended up good enough to put on Spotify, and many people had one or two songs they really liked (and got stuck in their head). But besides that, I know it doesn't sound like a "professional pop album". But you have to start somewhere and I learned from my mistakes :)
