_Dusk_ is part 1 of an instrumenal twin album. (Part 2 is called [Dawn](/en/music/instrumental/dawn) and was released later.)

The official page provides the music, but also some background, and a diary about the development.

The twin album is about a sad event in my life: the sudden death of my brother.

I wanted to make two short albums, instead of a long one, because there's a split feeling connected to the event. On the one hand it's a horrible event that made me temporarily lose hope and motivation ("dusk"), on the other hand it gave me energy and strength to start a new adventure in the creative field ("dawn").
