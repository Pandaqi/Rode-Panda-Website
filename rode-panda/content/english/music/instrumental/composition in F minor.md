_Composition in F Minor_ is my first instrumental album. 

Being my first album, there are _many_ rough edges, and I would certainly like to re-record all the songs with the skills I have today. Nevertheless, I'm very proud of it and think it's a beautiful and diverse piece of music.

The album is named after the first track. Not only is it the most beautiful track of the album, it also has a special place in my heart: I wrote it just before my brother died, which is why I devoted the composition to him.
