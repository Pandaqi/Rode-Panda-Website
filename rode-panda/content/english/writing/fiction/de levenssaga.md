_The Saga of Life_ (Dutch: "De Levenssaga") is such an extraordinary project that I can't explain it in one sentence. 

_This project is, however, only available in Dutch. Sorry._

It's a **frame story**. It consists of short independent stories. But when you read multiple, they combine to tell a _bigger_ story of a world filled with life.

It tells **universal tales**. The style is a mixture of myths, legends, folktales, and the like. This makes the stories timeless and readable for all ages.

It's about **the history of life on earth**. But it explains this in a creative, magical and exciting way. From the dawn of our rocky planet, until the dawn of mankind, even a bit into the future, in which we might roam the galaxy. Important concepts and events will appear in _The Saga of Life_, one way or the other.

It was built to **always be able to grow**. There's a plan, a timeline, many stories into the future. I've also consciously left gaps, so there's always _more_ to be told about life. It might take _my_ whole life until the last tale is written.

It's a **free website**. To go with the times. To make the stories as pretty and accessible as possible, no matter your background, device or financial state. To automatically keep track of metadata, which gives me a sort of Wikipedia about the project.

With the exception of a _frame story_, I've never seen these elements in other projects. And certainly not all at once. It's therefore quite experimental and only time will tell if this starts a new wave of storytelling ... or ends up being a terrible idea.

For now it's a beautiful website with hopefully just as beautiful tales. (At the time of writing it has 10 stories with a total of roughly 120,000 words.)
