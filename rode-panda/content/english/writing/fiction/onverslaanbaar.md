Jinny meets the man of her dreams: a writer who recently became a millionaire after publishing a world-famous bestseller. Just as she inserts herself into his life, someone is murdered and all his friends are prime suspects.

_This book is, unfortunately, only available in Dutch. It's called "Onverslaanbaar"._

## What's special?

It's my first thriller (with a hint of romance), with adult women as the main target audience. Why? Because those were the requirements of the writing contest to which I submitted this piece.

It's also my first novella! (The word count is somewhere between a short story and a full-length novel.)
