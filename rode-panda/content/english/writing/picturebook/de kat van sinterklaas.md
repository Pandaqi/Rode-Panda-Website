_The Cat of Saint Nicholas_ is my first picture book, self-published through Brave New Books. (Only available in Dutch.)

It was originally meant as a big gift for my little sister, nothing more. But when shown to friends and family they all said: "you should publish this man!" 

So I did. To my surprise, the book is actually being bought and receiving favorable reviews. Which I see as a huge success!
