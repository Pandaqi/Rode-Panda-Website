_School of Rabbits_ is a Dutch picture book written and drawn by me. (Only available in Dutch.) It's self-published with MyBestseller. 

It contains 20 full-color, handdrawn pages telling a story about passion for education, both the learning and the teaching.

It started as a supportive story for teachers having a hard time under all the pressure our education system puts onto them.

However, I wrote the book during the Coronacrisis. And when schools had to close (again), the story also become a reminder for children, about how useful it was to learn new things. And to not waste their time sitting still, or playing games, but to continue their learning from home.
