_Square Ogre_ is an interactive picture book and a video game. Both can be bought and played/used separately, but they complement each other and share some of their content.

Visit the official pages:
* [Picture book](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/boeken/vierkante-ogre) (in Dutch only)
* [Puzzle game](https://pandaqi.com/square-ogre) (English; available anywhere)

This is by far the biggest and most ambitious project I've done (at the moment of writing). The picture book is 111 pages. The video game has 500 puzzles. But I'm very happy with the results!

I think this project showcases my skills and interests really well. It combines all areas in which I work into one, huge, coherent product which I made with an abundance of passion.
