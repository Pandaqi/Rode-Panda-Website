_The Kingdom of Upside Down_ is a "pixel picture book"! (Only available in Dutch.)

I noticed there weren't any picture books using the "pixel art" style for their drawings. (This style was popularized by video games when we still had low-resolution screens, and was e.g. used in the first Mario game.) 

As such, I tried to create one, and it ended up being a very special story about being happy with what you have (instead of always wanting more ... _pixels_).

Another special element is that, about 30% into the book, the world _splits in two_. From that moment, you get two stories running in parallel (one in the top half, one in the bottom half, which is turned upside down). Hence, the name of the book.
