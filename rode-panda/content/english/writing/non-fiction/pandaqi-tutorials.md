I've always been a jack of all trades: someone who wanted to learn and do everything. As I got older, I also developed the burning desire to teach others what I'd learned.

To achieve this I, launched a website in 2015 called _Pandaqi Tutorials_. 

In 2023, this website received a huge overhaul (new look, faster, higher quality of writing) and many new courses. I expect to repeat this pattern: roughly every 10 years, I'll have learned some new skills to write about, and the website will have aged.

## What's special?

The complete website has been designed from scratch to display tutorials in the best way possible. To be extremely fast and easy to navigate, without adding ads or any other clutter.

It was also my first professional website. It taught me how to write (in English), how to design systems for large volumes of content, how to create tools to elevate the tutorials (such as an interactive audio tool for the courses on audio), and more.

I've written two in-depth articles about it, albeit only in Dutch!

* The creation and development of the website: [Het ontstaan van Pandaqi](https://tiamopastoor.com/blog/2019/2019-03-18-het-ontstaan-van-pandaqi/)
* The rewrite and overhaul: [Pandaqi Tutorials (v2)](https://tiamopastoor.com/blog/2023/2023-12-15-pandaqi-tutorials-het-jubileum-van-twijfels/)

Currently, the website hosts 30 full courses, each containing between 5 to 30 individual articles ( = tutorials). Especially the most recent ones are professional products that attract a lot of visitors to this day.
