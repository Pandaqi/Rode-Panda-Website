A fellow student (at university) asked if someone knew anything about Wordpress. I responded that I knew quite a lot about websites in general, expecting a simple question that needed answering. 

Before I knew it, I had a job managing and updating the website from a professional photographer.

For a handful of years, I've written many of the articles, solved minor issues with the website/code, and updated the content. (The actual website design is from another freelancer.)

This job taught me a lot and was the turning point that gave me the confidence to become a freelancer myself.
