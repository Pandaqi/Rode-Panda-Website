My (board)game work has, over the years, grown to be my main field of work. That's why I've created a whole blog to talk about the development of these games and gaming in general.

To my complete surprise, the blog amassed near 100,000 words and a steady stream of visitors in the 6 months since its inception.

Apparently, I love talking about the creation of my games, the problems I face and how I solved them. And others really like reading about it. So I kept going and the blog is growing absolutely huge.

It's a good place to visit if you want to read about my _process_ behind development. How I solved problems, what I tried, why I made certain decisions.
