One day I received an email asking if I wanted to be a co-writer for an official book on programming video games.

They'd found a few small games I'd put online, built with a relatively new and unknown game engine, and said they were impressed. I was honored&mdash;of course I wanted to help!

In the end I wrote a handful (English) chapters for the book "Teach Yourself Godot in 24 Hours"

My name is not on the front page, because some of my co-writers were much bigger names in the game industry. But if you look inside the book, you'll find me (Tiamo Pastoor / Pandaqi).
