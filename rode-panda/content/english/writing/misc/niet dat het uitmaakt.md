_Not That It Matters_ is the name of my personal blog, which is completely _Dutch_. (As such, if you want to read the articles, you'll have to rely on the amazing translations by Google Translate.)

The blog has grown unbelievably huge over the years (partly due to the versatility of my work). Here are some links to the interesting parts of it:

- [Reviews](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/rare-recensies)
- [Simulations](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/zinderende-simulaties)
- [Cartoons](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/cartoons)
- [Short stories](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl/vluchtig-verhaal)

It started as a default WordPress installation and existing design template. (I just wanted to start as quickly as possible and write some blogs.)

But when I started receiving more and more visitors, I decided this just wouldn't do. That's why I created my own WordPress theme from scratch and custom-built the whole website on top of the tiniest WordPress installation I could manage.
