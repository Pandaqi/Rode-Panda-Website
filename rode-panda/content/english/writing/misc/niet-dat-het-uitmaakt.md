_Not That It Matters_ was the name of my personal blog, which is completely _Dutch_. (As such, if you want to read the articles, you'll have to rely on the amazing translations by Google Translate.)

The blog grew unbelievably huge over the years (partly due to the versatility of my work).

It started as a default WordPress installation and existing design template. (I just wanted to start as quickly as possible and write some blogs.)

But when I started receiving more and more visitors, I decided this just wouldn't do. That's why I created my own WordPress theme from scratch and custom-built the whole website on top of the tiniest WordPress installation I could manage.

After ~8 years of non-stop blogging on this website as my "personal online home", it was moved to a [new author's website](https://tiamopastoor.com). This one was far more professional, built from the ground to display writing work, and most of all _English_ from now on.

The old domain stayed online for a while to smoothen this transition, and simply because I'd already paid for that anyway.

And so it happened that a year later, mere months before the domain name expired, I decided to completely repurpose it for my first attempt at an **online store**. This meant all traces of the old blog (on this domain) were now gone; but the website itself would stay online for much longer.
