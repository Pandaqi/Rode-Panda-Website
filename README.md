# Rode Panda

This is the full source code / project behind [Rode Panda (my Portfolio)](https://rodepanda.com).

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

The actual website is inside `rode-panda`, everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. In fact, you'll find many finished projects planned to release in the future, if you know where to look ;) 

The website is multilingual: Dutch (`nl` folder) and English (`en` folder).

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do.
